# Step: Test-First

## Goal
Author automated tests specifying the required behavior changes BEFORE writing production code.

## Rules
- Test-first scope: modify files under test paths (`paths.tests`). You may introduce new (never modified) interface-stub files under production paths (`paths.prod`) within the engine-enforced stub budget so tests of new modules can collect/compile. Existing production code must remain untouched.
- Red expectation: every declared test must fail on the current production codebase because the functionality does not yet exist. A test that fails due to compilation/syntax/import errors does NOT satisfy target-red.
- Prove test infra first: confirm the runner executes your new tests and reports failures correctly before declaring the target.
- Target declaration in yield:
  - Standard story: yield `target: { selectors: ["<test-file-or-pattern>"], expectRed: ["<test-case-id-1>", "<test-case-id-2>"] }` (both required; `expectRed` non-empty).
  - Test id format: declare `expectRed` ids in the runner's native node-id form (e.g. pytest `tests/test_math.py::test_add`); the engine normalizes node ids against JUnit ids when matching.
  - Bootstrap story (no test runner exists yet): yield `target: { gate: "<gate-id>" }` or `target: { command: "<test-command>", customTarget: true }`. The gate/command itself must currently fail (red).
- Never test lint/format rules: assert behavior, never style or compiler-guaranteed facts. Debloat test code preserving intent.
- Output: yield structured output per `developer-output.schema.json`.
