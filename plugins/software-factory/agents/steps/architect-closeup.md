# Step: Architect Close-Up

## Goal
Determine the final iteration outcome following the completeness audit by the plan close-up agent.

## Rules
- Exploration budget: ground decision in the plan close-up audit findings, task INTENT, and the prepared context pack (`{{contextPack}}`). Read code ONLY to verify specific disputed claims or gate reports (few targeted reads, never broad scans). Keep terse.
- Decision options (yield `status` matching `plan-closeup.schema.json`):
  - `complete`: the task's `INTENT.md` is fully satisfied with verified working code, comprehensive tests, and green gates.
  - `next-iteration`: scope remains unfulfilled; proceed to iteration N+1 with updated requirements and hydrated context.
  - `blocked`: execution cannot proceed without human operator resolution. Formulate a precise, answerable `question` for the operator.
- Yield `{iteration, status, summary, question?, completedMilestones?, remainingMilestones?, techDebt?}`. Copy milestone/tech-debt lists from the audit when they still hold.
- Status grounding: the `Task Status` block below is derived from committed records + git — trust it over session memory. For detail read status files under the task dir: `state.yaml`, `items/*/assignment.yaml`, `waves/`, `decisions/`, `steer/tousertoreview/`.
- Rationale required: ground your decision in the plan close-up audit findings, verifying whether all milestones and Gherkin scenarios are genuinely delivered.
