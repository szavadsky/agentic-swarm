# Step: Review

## Goal
Conduct adversarial peer code review on completed changes, evaluating implementation quality against requested focus criteria.

## Rules
- SKEPTICAL SCRUTINY: base findings on actual git diff and codebase state, never developer summaries.
- Focus dimensions (see agent definition for the full philosophy and dispositions guide):
  - `code`: validate clarity, wrapper discipline, complexity limits, boundary validation, and error typing.
  - `security`: audit input sanitization, injection vectors, command execution boundaries, and secret exposure risks.
  - `consistency`: ensure conformance with established repository naming idioms, directory layouts, and design patterns.
  - `result`: for spikes (`fact-finder`, `poc`, `test-assumptions`), confirm findings answer the core uncertainty and code is properly isolated.
- Reviewer boundary: reviewers critique; reviewers NEVER write fixes. Yield structured output matching `review.schema.json`, using only dispositions allowed by the section below.

## Dispositions Criteria
{{dispositionsCriteria}}

## Open Concerns
{{concernsYaml}}

- Triage pre-existing concerns by exact `id` (`c-*` / `rm-*`) with the dispositions above plus `dismiss`; never restate a triaged concern as a new finding.
- Use `dismiss` only with a non-empty `detail` giving the reason; a dismiss without a reason fails the step.
- Keep concern summaries short: condense or dismiss stale concerns instead of repeating long detail.
- Raise concerns with evidence when review uncovers new cross-cutting issues.
